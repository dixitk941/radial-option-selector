Karan! The "Radial Option Selector" has two key files: an HTML file and a CSS file. Both files work together to make the selector function properly.

To get it running smoothly, just adjust the image paths in the CSS file. Avoid changing anything in the HTML file to keep everything working as intended.

Keep the HTML file unchanged and focus only on updating the image paths in the CSS file. This way, you'll ensure the Radial Option Selector works without any issues. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask!
